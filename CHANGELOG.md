# Consent2Share 2.1.2 (2017-07-25)

### Features

Node.js released a [security update]( https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2017-security-releases/) on July 11, 2017. Node.js stated that updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. These include the fix for the high severity vulnerability identified in a previous announcement, one additional lower priority Node.js vulnerability in the 4.x release line, as well as some lower priority fixes for Node.js dependencies across the current release lines. 

The following Consent2Share projects have been enhanced to accommodate the most recent LTS version of Node.js (6.11.1), which includes the security updates:

* **Patient Portal UI**
* **Admin Portal UI** 

Consent2Share V2.1.2 does not affect build artifacts such as JARs and Docker images which were made available during release V2.1.1. You can continue to use the latest Docker images from the Docker Hub. However, if you are currently coding, contributing to our code base, and building your own binary artifacts from the Consent2Share source code, make certain to use Consent2Share V2.1.2, which accommodates the Node.js 6.11.1 security update.
