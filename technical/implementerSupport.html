                                            those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                                            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which
                                            such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
                                            (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
                                            Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
                                            infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
                                            terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                                            D. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
                                            thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
                                            provided that You meet the following conditions:
                                            1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
                                            License; and
                                            2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
                                            changed the files; and
                                            3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
                                            copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the
                                            Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
                                            Works; and
                                            4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
                                            Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
                                            notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                                            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
                                            within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
                                            Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                                            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
                                            notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
                                            purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                                            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
                                            the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
                                            cannot be construed as modifying the License.
                                            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
                                            additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
                                            distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
                                            provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
                                            with the conditions stated in this License.
                                            E. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
                                            intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                                            terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                                            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
                                            separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
                                            Contributions.
                                            F. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
                                            service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                                            customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
                                            NOTICE file.
                                            G. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
                                            Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
                                            BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                                            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
                                            MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You
                                            are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the
                                            Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                                            H. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
                                            negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
                                            grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
                                            damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
                                            character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
                                            (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
                                            or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                                            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                                            I. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
                                            Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
                                            support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                                            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and
                                            on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
                                            indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                                            claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
                                            additional liability.
